            <h2 class="header2">Bio</h2>
            <p>I am Arianne Ray P. De Mesa, commonly called Ray.
                I'm a 4th-year BS Computer Engineering at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.
                In addition to being an 'Iskolar ng Bayan', I'm also a DOST-SEI scholar 
                who aspires to use her skills and knowledge in aiding the nation's problems 
                through innnovation and technology.</p>
            <p>My interests include designing hence my former dream to be a graphic designer.
                This pushed me to UI/UX designing, as it relates to my current 
                program. Working with basic UI/UX design made me curious in the works of Front-End 
                Developers, about on how they make a design into functional one, which then led me to pursue
                being a developer myself.</p>
